    <hr/>
    <h1>CS335 Projects</h1>
    The CS335 course project is your opportunity to apply state-of-the-art machine learning methods to one of three "impactful" application areas: (A) Health, (B) Education, or (C) Climate Change. 

    <br>
    <br>
    Aside from intrinsic benefit, course projects are an opportunity to demonstrate your machine learning knowledge and potentially add to a portfolio you can use for job or graduate school applications. Previous students have even submitted outstanding course projects for <b>publication</b>!  

    <h2> Logistics</h2>

    <li>
        Project groups will have <b>minimum 2 students</b> and <b>maximum 3 students</b>. 
    </li>

    <li> Students are expected to contribute equally to the project. The amount of work should scale to the number of students in the group and will be graded as such (groups with 3 students will be expected to produce more work than groups with 2 students). 
    </li>

    <li>
        Examples and resources will be focused on the three "impactful" application areas. However, students may propose a project that is outside these three areas if they can convince the instructor it is also impactful. 
    </li>

    <h2> Grading </h2>
    The <b>project</b> grade (30%) is further broken down to: 
    <li>Idea proposal &mdash; 2% </li>
    <li>Paper and group selection &mdash; 2% </li>
    <li> Literature review &mdash; 5% </li>
    <li> Weekly reports (3) &mdash; 6% </li>
    <li> Final presentation (poster session) &mdash; 5% </li>
    <li> Final report &mdash; 10% </li>

<h2> (1) Idea Proposal (Due: March 6, 11:59pm)</h2>
Every student must submit their own <b>individual</b> idea proposal (even if you already know your group members).
The first step for every project is to generate as many ideas as possible.

<br>
<br>
Your idea proposal must contain several sentences for each of the following questions:
<ol type="1">
<li> What is your <b>research question?</b></li>
<li> What are 1-3 <b>datasets</b> that could be used to answer this research question?</li>
<li> What machine learning <b>models/methods</b> do you plan to use (e.g. logistic regression, neural networks, clustering)?</li>
</ol> 

For the idea proposal, you will submit in two places: 
<li> Gradescope: Submit as a pdf. </li>
<li> Piazza: Submit as a post under the <b>idea_proposal</b> tab. You must use your name (do not post anonymously). </li>
<br>
You will submit your idea proposal publicly so that other students can see and comment on your proposed idea. 
Proposals will be graded based on completion.


<!-- The Idea Proposal consists of two stages: (1) write-up your proposal idea with THIS format, and (2) read 5 other people's proposal. What are the strengths? What are the weaknesses? (3) Form groups. 
<br>
<br>
Proposal should have (1) Research question, (2) Dataset (must have a dataset), (3) Methodology ideas, (4) Ethical considerations, (5) Evaluation (performance metrics). Must contain at least one visualization!  -->

<h2> (2) Form groups (Before March 13)</h2>
After idea proposals are turned in March 6, read all the other students posts on Piazza. Message or talk with other students to form groups before the paper selection submission on March 13. 

<h2> (3) Paper and group selection (Due: March 13, 11:59pm) </h2>
A useful resource to search for relevant papers is <a href="https://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a>. 

<br>
<br>
For this submission, please answer the following questions: 
<ol type="1">
<li> What are the <b>names</b> of your group members?</li>
<li> What is your group's <b> research question?</b> </li>
<li> Let the number of members of your group be equal to n. List 4*n papers that relate to your research question (Note: you should skim but NOT fully read these papers). 
</ol> 

Submit this assignment <b>as a group</b> to Gradescope. (Instructions for submitting an assignment as a group on Gradescope are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rue7p_kATLA">here</a>.)


<h2> (4) Literature Review (Due: March 27, 11:59pm)</h2>
Given your selected papers (Step 3), skim the papers again. You should have gathered more papers than you actually plan to read. Select 2*n papers (where n is the number of group members) to read thoroughly. 

<br>
<br>
For each paper chosen, answer the following questions: 
<ol type="1">
    <li>What venue was the paper published in? Who are the authors? What are their backgrounds? How many times has the paper been cited? (~3-5 sentences)</li>
    <li>What problem are the authors trying to solve? (~2 sentences)</li>
    <li> Why is the problem important (2-5 sentences)? </li>
    <li>What mathematical notation do the authors use and what does this notation mean? This is often most useful represented as a table. 
    <li> Make a list of five terms that you do not understand from your paper. For each, do a bit of
research and write a brief description of the term. (∼2 sentences each.)</li>
<li> What datasets did the authors use (if any)? Why did they use these datasets? (~2 sentences)
<li> What machine learning models did the authors use (if any)? Why did they justify using these? (~2 sentences)</li> 
    <li> How did the authors know their approach was successful? (~10 sentences)
        <ol type="A">
            <li>What evaluation metrics did they use? What do these metrics mean?</li>
            <li>What baselines did they compare against?</li>
            <li>Can you identify a problem with the authors' measure of success?</li>
        </ol>
<li> Research papers are almost always an improvement, reaction or twist on other research (“prior work”) that others have done before. Of all of the works cited in your paper, what
seems to be the most important cited prior work? Explain why that citation seems
most important. (4-6 sentences) </li>
<li> Research papers almost always make use of tools, methods and algorithms that
have been developed by others. Of all of the works cited in your paper, what citation of a
tool, method or algorithm seems most important? Explain why. (4-6 sentences)</li>
<li> Pick one equation from the paper and explain what it means using a mix of prose and mathematical notation (~5 sentences).</li>
<li>How is your project similar and different from this paper? (4-5 sentences) </li>
</ol>

<br>
As a group, submit this as a single pdf document to Gradescope. 

<h2> (4) Weekly reports (Due: April 3, 10, 17, 11:59pm)</h2>
After the literature review, you will submit three weekly reports. The purpose of the reports is to make sure you are on track with your project and uncover any major problems so you can quickly change course if necessary. The reports should answer the following questions: 
<ol type="1">
<li> What activities did you do this week? </li>
<li> What preliminary results do you have? </li>
<li> What issues have you encountered? </li>
<li> What questions do you have? </li>
<li> What are concrete steps (for next week)? </li>
<li> What are longer-term todo items? </li>
</ol>

<br>
You will submit in two places: 
<li> Gradescope: As a group, submit a single pdf document . </li>
<li> Piazza: Submit as a post under the <b>weekly_report_k</b> tab (where k is the week). The purpose of public posts are for you to learn from your classmates and share information. </li>
<br>


<h2> (5) Presentation (Due: April 28, in class)</h2>
Final presentations will be a poster session on the last day of classes (April 28.) More details about the format of the posters to come. 

<h2> (6) Final Report (Due: April 28, 11:59pm)</h2>
The final report will consist of a 6-10 page research write-up. More details about the format to come.
